# Cuckoo: A Custom Confluence Importer for Outline
This is the result of:
- needing to migrate from Confluence
- madness and
- lack of sleep.

As a result, the code is bad, unoptimized, and doesn't work for everything.
I will change that (and publish this repository at some point), but for now, it's private.

This README is just for the entertainment of whoever wants to look through the commit history. Have fun!
